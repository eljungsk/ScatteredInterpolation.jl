"""
    interpolate(method, points, samples; metric = Euclidean(), returnRBFmatrix = false)

Create an interpolation of the data in `samples` sampled at the locations defined in
`points` based on the interpolation method `method`. `metric` is any of the metrics defined
by the `Distances` package. The RBF matrix used for solving the weights can be returned with
the boolean `returnRBFmatrix`.

`points` should be an ``n×k`` matrix, where ``n`` is dimension of the sampled space and
``k`` is the number of points. This means that each column in the matrix defines one point.

`samples` is an ``k×m`` array, where ``k`` is the number of sampled points (same as for
`points`) and ``m`` is the dimension of the sampled data.

The returned `ScatteredInterpolant` object can be passed to `evaluate` to interpolate the
data to new points.

"""
    evaluate(itp, points)

Evaluate an interpolation object `itp` at the locations defined in `points`.

`points` should be an ``n×k`` matrix, where ``n`` is dimension of the sampled space and
``k`` is the number of points. This means that each column in the matrix defines one point.
